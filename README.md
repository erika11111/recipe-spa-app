# recipe-spa-app

A recipe application was developed utilizing TheMealDB API.  Users have the ability to search and view various meal categories, and based on their selection, they can access recipes. Each recipe includes a photo, description, ingredient list, and video. The category search feature was implemented using the useLocation and useNavigate hooks from React Router.
